      <h2> PURPOSE </h2>
      <div id="purpose-text">
	<h3>The purpose of this study is</h3>
	<p>
	  To document and analyze the practice of national-level
	  Internet censorship through the creation of a global network
	  of researchers running censorship measurement software.
	  This measurement software will run tests from your computer
	  or dedicated hardware device which attempt to access a list
	  of sensitive URLs. The software will collect data from these
	  tests and send it back to servers hosted at the University
	  of Toronto which are maintained by the researchers. Data
	  will be analyzed at Stony Brook University.  These data will
	  be used to determine what content is being censored, what
	  technical methods are used for censorship and how censorship
	  changes over time.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It is anticipated that there will be 15 subjects in the
	  study overall. It is not anticipated that any will enroll at
	  SBUStony Brook University. You are eligible to participate
	  in this research if you have a computer that meets the
	  software’s minimum requirements and you have signed this
	  consent form.

      <h2> PROCEDURES </h2>
      <div id="procedures-text">
	<h3>If you decide to be in the study, your part will involve:</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Downloading a software client and installing it on to
	    your computer. This should take approximately 5 minutes
	    and only needs to be done once.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Running the software on your computer. The software will
	    run as a background process on your computer. It will run
	    tests for network censorship which may take up to one
	    hour, but do not require your interaction.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Uninstalling the software should you decide to no longer
	    participate in the project.
	  </li>

    <div id="risk">
      <h2>RISKS / DISCOMFORTS</h2>
      <div id="risk-text">
	<h3>The following risks/discomforts may occur as a result of
	you being in this study:</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Your ISP or network administrator may be able to see the
	    list of websites being accessed by the measurement
	    software. There is a risk that accessing such websites and
	    running these tests violates network policies.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    There is a risk that accessing these sensitive websites is
	    in violation of local laws or regulations.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  The potential risks posed by conducting these tests are
	  highly specific to the context in which the tests take
	  place. These risks are highly dependent on the domestic
	  political and legal context in your country.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The data that the tool will collect are regularly
	  transmitted on the Internet and the measurement tests do not
	  compromise, circumvent or otherwise disrupt the regular
	  functioning of the networks being probed. While we know of
	  no explicit laws that forbid the collection of network
	  measurements on Internet censorship, the nature of this
	  research can potentially have political impacts and could be
	  seen unfavorably by certain authorities. If an authority is
	  sensitive to information of its censorship regime being
	  exposed and views exposure as potentially damaging then
	  nationals of that country who are found to be engaged in
	  this study may be scrutinized by the authorities.
	</p>
	<p>
	  While it is challenging to definitively identify what the
	  risks of conducting these tests may be in your country, we
	  have compiled a number of metrics to help inform you of the
	  potential risks in your country:
	</p>

	<!-- insert stuff here to get country info-->
	<form action="go">
	  <select name="country">
	    <option value="USA">USA</option>
	    <option value="CAN">Canada</option>
	  </select>
	   <input type="submit">
	</form>

	<p>
	  These metrics are intended to provide three external sources
	  of information about the general political and legal
	  situation in your country.

      <h2> BENEFITS </h2>
      <div id="benefits-text">
	<p>
	  Throughout the 12 month duration of the project you will
	  receive analysis reports of the measurement experiments you
	  have participated in and have the ability to request
	  specific experiments to be run using the measurement
	  software. These reports and custom experiments may help you
	  gain a better understanding of the prevalence, depth, and
	  breadth of Internet filtering in your country.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If you do not consent to the study you may still opt-in to
	  receive aggregated reports summarizing the results of
	  experiments run in regions that are relevant to you, or you
	  may access these aggregated reports on our Web page:
	  www.internetcensorshiplab.org.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are no other direct benefits from participation in
	  this research study, although your participation may help
	  contribute to the public good by educating society about the
	  prevalence, depth, and breadth of Internet filtering around
	  the world.

      <div id="confid-text">
	<h3> Protecting Your Privacy in this Study </h3>
	<p>
	  We will take steps to help make sure that all the
	  information we get about you is kept private. Your name will
	  not be used wherever possible. We will use a tag (unique
	  alphanumerical user identifier) instead. This tag has been
	  provided to you with the measurement software and should be
	  used to indicate your consent to run the software at the end
	  of this form. All the study data that we get from you will
	  be on a machine in a secured computer network that is only
	  accessible to members of the research team.  The
	  code/mapping will be stored in an encrypted database
	  separate from the study results. If any papers and
	  talks are given about this research, neither your name nor
	  your IP address will be used.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Every effort will be made to maintain the strictest
	  confidentiality. Data will only be used for the purposes
	  outlined in the information and consent forms. Only members
	  of the research team will have access to personally
	  identifiable data. No information about research
	  participants, or provided by research participants during
	  the research, will be disclosed to others without the
	  participants’ written consent.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Electronic data will be stored in a secure server
	  environment maintained by the PIs. Any personally
	  identifiable data kept on computers outside of this secure
	  server environment will be encrypted at all times using
	  strong encryption (128 bit AES) except to the extent
	  researchers need to decrypt them during use.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Experiment data may include issuing requests for URLs found
	  in the URL list (similar to what a user does manually with a
	  browser, such as Firefox), DNS queries (mapping hostnames
	  such as Google.com to IP address such as 72.14.52.3), or
	  traceroutes (measuring network paths). Experiments may only
	  log network traffic associated with the experiment (e.g.,
	  network packets and timestamps).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Once an experiment has completed the resulting data will be
	  sent, along with the experiment ID and user ID, to the data
	  management system. Once the data management system confirms
	  receipt of the data it will be removed from the client
	  software. Sensitive data that will be collected and
	  transmitted is the IP address of the user. Experiment
	  results will be encrypted to ensure they are not observable
	  in transit and this personally identifiable data (as well as
	  the unique user ID) will only be accessible to researchers
	  at Stony Brook University and the University of Toronto.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Whenever the client communicates with the experiment
	  controller or the data management system the data will be
	  encrypted and may also be sent to a proxy (e.g., in Amazon
	  EC2 data centers) before being forwarded on to the target
	  system. The proxy will not store the data and will not
	  contain the key required to decrypt any data it forwards.
